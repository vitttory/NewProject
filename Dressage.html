<h1><i>Dressage</i></h1>

It emphasizes grace, harmony, and precision, requiring the horse to perform a series of complex movements with seemingly effortless control and responsiveness. Dressage showcases the deep connection and understanding between horse and rider, demonstrating the horse's training and flexibility.</h3></font>
